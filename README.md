   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend will run on `http://localhost:5173`

### Database Setup
- Ensure MongoDB is running locally on port 27017
- The application will automatically create the `todoboard` database
- No manual database setup required

## üéØ Usage Guide

### Getting Started
1. **Register/Login**: Create an account or sign in
2. **Create Tasks**: Click "Add New Task" to create your first task
3. **Manage Tasks**: Drag tasks between columns or use edit/delete actions
4. **Smart Assign**: Use the üéØ button to automatically assign tasks
5. **Activity Log**: Toggle the activity panel to see real-time updates

### Key Features Usage

#### Smart Assign Logic
The Smart Assign feature automatically assigns tasks to the user with the fewest active tasks (Todo + In Progress). This ensures balanced workload distribution across team members.

**How it works:**
1. Click the üéØ Smart Assign button on any task
2. System calculates active task count for each user
3. Task is automatically assigned to user with lowest count
4. Activity is logged for transparency

#### Conflict Handling
When multiple users edit the same task simultaneously:

1. **Detection**: System detects version conflicts
2. **Prevention**: Users are warned if someone else is editing
3. **Resolution**: Conflicting users see current state and can choose to:
   - Cancel their changes
   - Reload and try again with latest data

**Example Scenario:**
- User A starts editing Task #1
- User B tries to edit the same task
- User B sees: "Task is currently being edited by User A"
- If both submit changes, version conflict is detected
- Both users get resolution options

#### Real-time Features
- **Live Updates**: See task changes instantly
- **User Awareness**: Know when others are editing
- **Activity Feed**: Real-time log of all actions
- **Status Sync**: Drag-drop changes sync immediately

## üîß API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user
- `GET /api/auth/users` - Get all users

### Tasks
- `GET /api/tasks` - Get all tasks
- `POST /api/tasks` - Create new task
- `PUT /api/tasks/:id` - Update task
- `DELETE /api/tasks/:id` - Delete task
- `POST /api/tasks/:id/smart-assign` - Smart assign task
- `POST /api/tasks/:id/start-edit` - Start editing (conflict detection)
- `POST /api/tasks/:id/stop-edit` - Stop editing

### Activity
- `GET /api/activity` - Get recent activities
- `GET /api/activity/task/:taskId` - Get task-specific activities

#### Backend Setup
1. **Navigate to Backend Directory**
   ```bash
   cd Backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   npm install
   ```

   ```

4. **Start the Backend Server**

1. **Navigate to Frontend Directory**
   ```bash
   cd Frontend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**
   The `.env.local` file is configured for local development.
   For production builds, `.env.production` contains production URLs.

4. **Start the Frontend Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Dual Environment Support
The application automatically detects whether it's running in development or production mode:

- **Local Development**: Uses `localhost` URLs for API and Socket connections
- **Production**: Uses Render deployment URLs
- **Build Commands**: 
  - `npm run dev` - Local development
  - `npm run build` - Production build
  - `npm run build:local` - Local build for testing

## üìù Logic Document

### Smart Assign Implementation

The Smart Assign feature distributes workload fairly across team members by:

1. **Counting Active Tasks**: For each user, count tasks in "Todo" and "In Progress" status
2. **Finding Minimum**: Identify user(s) with the lowest active task count
3. **Assignment**: Assign the task to the first user with minimum tasks
4. **Update Counters**: Increment the assigned user's active task count
5. **Logging**: Record the smart assignment action with details

**Benefits:**
- Prevents task overload on specific users
- Ensures fair distribution of work
- Saves time on manual assignment decisions
- Provides transparency through activity logging

### Conflict Handling System

The conflict detection and resolution system works through:

1. **Version Tracking**: Each task has a version number that increments on updates
2. **Edit Locking**: When a user starts editing, the task is marked as "being edited"
3. **Conflict Detection**: Before saving, system checks if version has changed
4. **User Notification**: Conflicting users are presented with current state
5. **Resolution Options**: Users can choose to cancel or retry with latest data

**Conflict Types Handled:**
- Simultaneous editing (edit locking)
- Version conflicts (data divergence)
- Race conditions (atomic updates)

**Resolution Strategies:**
- Show current task state to users
- Allow informed decision making
- Prevent data loss through warnings
- Maintain data integrity through version control
